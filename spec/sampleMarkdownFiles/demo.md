# how it works
1. Given a person's words familiarity.
2. Show the person a text where words of low familiarity have hint.
3. Observe the person's behavior of looking up for words in the text.
4. Update the person's words familiarity by
    - descrease familiarity of the words the person looks up
    - increase familiarity of the rest of the words


# how to store a person's words familiarity
Each word has a value of familiarity. Familiarity can be either `unfamiliar = false` or `familiar = true`. An json object is to store a person's words familiarity. Words not in the object are by default `familiar`.
```js demo.html script
const wordsFamiliarity = {};
```

# which words should show hint
Show hint for `unfamiliar` words.
```js demo.html script
function shouldShowHint(wordsFamiliarity, word) {
  return wordsFamilarity[words] === false;
}
```

# how to update words familiarity
Mark words been looked up as `unfamiliar`. Mark other words as `familiar`.
```js demo.html script
function lookedUp(wordsFamiliarity, word) {
  wordsFamiliarity[word] = false;
}

function notLookedUp(wordsFamiliarity, word) {
  wordsFamiliarity[word] = true;
}
```

# how to get translation
- An API that to return simple explaination (hint below text) (Google traslation?).
- Another API to get full explaination (tooltip on selection) (Youdao?).
