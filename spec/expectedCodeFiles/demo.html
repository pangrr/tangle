    Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the <span hint="脾">spleen</span> and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing <span hint="严峻">grim</span> about the mouth; whenever it is a <span hint="潮湿">damp</span>, <span hint="蒙蒙">drizzly</span> November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before <span hint="棺材">coffin</span> warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my <span hint="狂躁">hypos</span> <span hint="
    得到这样的优势">get such an upper hand of</span> me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for <span hint="手枪">pistol</span> and ball. With a <span hint="哲学上">philosophical</span> <span hint="繁荣">flourish</span> Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, <span hint="珍爱">cherish</span> very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
